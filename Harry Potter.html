        who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts
        School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the
        school, and with the help of his friends, he faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who
        killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.

        The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of
        messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened and that the
        "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found
        after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and
        Hermione investigate the attacks.
